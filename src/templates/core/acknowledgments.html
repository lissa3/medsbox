            </p>My name is Tanja. I created this site myself using python and javascript.
             <p>
                 If it is a success, I have to thank my  <a href="https://github.com/joeribekker" class="general">
                     former colleagues
                 </a>who encouraged me to write a clean code.

             </p>
             <p>

                 If some parts of the site don't  work, I dedicate it to them as well for not supervising me enough .
             </p>

            Thanks to my husband for years of remaining calm.
